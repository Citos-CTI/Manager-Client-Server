# Manager Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Citos-CTI/Manager-Client-Server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Citos-CTI/Manager-Client-Server)

This is the backend which connects to the specific telephony servers. The Manager Clients will register here.

## Setup
### Network Structure/Architecture 
It's not required to run the Citos CTI Manager Server directly on the telephony server. It's highly recommended to adjust your firewall and network settings (espc. between Citos and telephony server) to prevent possible attacks.
### Requirements:
- Asterisk Server (tested with versions 12-15)
- Java 9 Runtime
